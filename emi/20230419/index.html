<ul>
<li>sneaking; player is
<ul>
<li>able to be heard</li>
<li>able to be seen</li>
<li>able to be chased</li>
<li>able to be looked for</li>
<li>able to be given up on after being chased or looked for</li>
<li>able to take some steps to avoid having these things happen, e.g. crouching, not running</li>
<li>under certain conditions able to escape once caught</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>combat (we need an alternative); player is
<ul>
<li>able to fight when sneaking fails (against bad odds)</li>
<li>unable to use fighting as a dominant strategy most of the time</li>
<li>disincentived from getting caught by way of fighting; raises stakes for sneaking and puzzling</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>social skills (potential alt to combat); player is
<ul>
<li>able to determine own stats by in story actions</li>
<li>able to make dialogue choices</li>
<li>represented within a social graph
<ul>
<li>edges have types, e.g. trust, influence</li>
<li>people are connected reciprocally or not</li>
<li>edge distance (and summed edges = path distance) can be used like a stat
<ul>
<li>maybe this should be relied on as a stand-in for stats, i.e. you are your relationships, they change with your capabilities and play history</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>how does turn based play affect pacing and what should we do about it?
<ul>
<li>timers on choices?</li>
<li>AL recs persona 5 and watching D&amp;D podcast for turn based plot determination</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>puzzling
<ul>
<li>level design
<ul>
<li>we need to make familiar places new again for level design
<ul>
<li>let's try to stumble into a gameplay element, e.g.
<ul>
<li>shuffle up layouts during a dream, on drugs, etc</li>
<li>severance as an example of building interest with reused sets</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>AL wants to learn godot &amp; LS wants to learn blender so we're going to split up the code &amp; art for our new milestone. here's the criteria:</p>
<ul>
<li>1 navigable space</li>
<li>1 player</li>
<li>1 npc</li>
<li>sorta believable movement</li>
</ul>
