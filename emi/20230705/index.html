<p>LS points to hit</p>
<ul>
<li>I want to talk about going back to 2d pixel art
<ul>
<li>I'm gonna need to make a lot of content and 2D was a bit more fun to learn and spend time on; i have a clearer sense of style with 2D as well</li>

</li>
<li>I want to talk about attachment theory and how to make systems out of it
<ul>
<li>how to make a stealth game that instead of asymmetrical combat mechanics uses social and emotional costs as a disincentive to being caught (but also leaves open surprises for those who do get caught regularly or in certain circumstances)</li>
<li>the levels are typically situations in which being avoidant and dismissive is healthier than one might be if a sense of security and secure attachment were possible</li>
<li>I almost want to build a stealth game on top of the foundations of a sim game</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>log</p>
<ul>
<li>demo looks amazing!
<ul>
<li>especially until we have a prototype that proves we have fun core gameplay, I'm convinced that we should stick with 3D</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>LS: what are inverse kinematics bones and how do they work?</li>
<li>we agree that a drone sidekick character would be a good repository for all movement mechanics beyond the core of sneaking/walking
<ul>

<li>sonic punk (link above)</li>
<li>other spookier potential inspo :D would be <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/5/5/23058160/drone-swarm-autonomous-navigation-dense-forest-person-tracking">a drone swarm</a>
<ul>
<li>reminds me of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jRJiY8UjpOU">tachikoma</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>AL brings up &quot;passing&quot;, traversing spaces socially, spatially, academically
<ul>
<li>&quot;passing&quot; is a really good <a href="https://austinkleon.com/2022/12/21/in-one-word/">one word</a> to drive the development of plot, character, and so on</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>LS really wants a shader in place; games w cool shaders
<ul>
<li>jet set radio future (this sounds amazing)</li>
<li>wind waker</li>
<li>okami</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>action items</p>
<ul>
<li>AL: will strip out enemies, jumping, then PR his work; then work on sneaking code and refining the feel of the movement mechanics</li>
<li>LS: will make an indoor, equal elevation stage with a bunch of twists and turns and less realism; then she'll make a sneaking animation</li>
</ul>
<p>next meeting let's discuss</p>
<ul>
<li>what shader we could try using to smooth out the low poly models</li>
<li>attachment theory as the basis for a sim / social mechanic</li>
</ul>
