## notes

### camera

- should follow player until you hit a stage wall a la pokemon
- the seeing through the roof problem ~ how does the camera avoid rendering ceilings/floors above the player
  - could filter everything out above the camera's vertical position
  - for now, let's just avoid vertical dimension

### the stage/ground

- outside
- the hallway problem ~ the realistic source hallways are designed to be impossible to sneak around
  - hallway surveillance might patrol
  - hide behind static things or dynamic things like opening doors
    - environment is active; people moving can block visibility
  - secret passages
  - if we have a vertical axis, climbing building exterior
