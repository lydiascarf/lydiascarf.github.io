### key game mechanics

- sneaking; player is
  - able to be heard
  - able to be seen
  - able to be chased
  - able to be looked for
  - able to be given up on after being chased or looked for
  - able to take some steps to avoid having these things happen, e.g. crouching, not running
  - under certain conditions able to escape once caught
- combat (we need an alternative); player is
  - able to fight when sneaking fails (against bad odds)
  - unable to use fighting as a dominant strategy most of the time
  - disincentived from getting caught by way of fighting; raises stakes for sneaking and puzzling
- social skills (potential alt to combat); player is
  - able to determine own stats by in story actions
  - able to make dialogue choices
  - represented within a social graph
    - edges have types, e.g. trust, influence
    - people are connected reciprocally or not
    - edge distance (and summed edges = path distance) can be used like a stat
      - maybe this should be relied on as a stand-in for stats, i.e. you are your relationships, they change with your capabilities and play history
  - how does turn based play affect pacing and what should we do about it?
    - timers on choices?
    - AL recs persona 5 and watching D&D podcast for turn based plot determination
- puzzling
  - level design
    - we need to make familiar places new again for level design
      - let's try to stumble into a gameplay element, e.g.
        - shuffle up layouts during a dream, on drugs, etc
        - severance as an example of building interest with reused sets

AL wants to learn godot & LS wants to learn blender so we're going to split up the code & art for our new milestone. here's the criteria:

- 1 navigable space
- 1 player
- 1 npc
- sorta believable movement
