LS points to hit

- I want to talk about going back to 2d pixel art
  - I'm gonna need to make a lot of content and 2D was a bit more fun to learn and spend time on; i have a clearer sense of style with 2D as well

- I want to talk about attachment theory and how to make systems out of it
  - how to make a stealth game that instead of asymmetrical combat mechanics uses social and emotional costs as a disincentive to being caught (but also leaves open surprises for those who do get caught regularly or in certain circumstances)
  - the levels are typically situations in which being avoidant and dismissive is healthier than one might be if a sense of security and secure attachment were possible
  - I almost want to build a stealth game on top of the foundations of a sim game

log

- demo looks amazing!
  - especially until we have a prototype that proves we have fun core gameplay, I'm convinced that we should stick with 3D
- LS: what are inverse kinematics bones and how do they work?
- we agree that a drone sidekick character would be a good repository for all movement mechanics beyond the core of sneaking/walking

  - sonic punk (link above)
  - other spookier potential inspo :D would be [a drone swarm](https://www.theverge.com/2022/5/5/23058160/drone-swarm-autonomous-navigation-dense-forest-person-tracking)
    - reminds me of [tachikoma](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jRJiY8UjpOU)
- AL brings up "passing", traversing spaces socially, spatially, academically
  - "passing" is a really good [one word](https://austinkleon.com/2022/12/21/in-one-word/) to drive the development of plot, character, and so on
- LS really wants a shader in place; games w cool shaders
  - jet set radio future (this sounds amazing)
  - wind waker
  - okami

action items

- AL: will strip out enemies, jumping, then PR his work; then work on sneaking code and refining the feel of the movement mechanics
- LS: will make an indoor, equal elevation stage with a bunch of twists and turns and less realism; then she'll make a sneaking animation

next meeting let's discuss

- what shader we could try using to smooth out the low poly models
- attachment theory as the basis for a sim / social mechanic
